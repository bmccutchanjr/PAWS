PAWS
====

PAWS is inspired by the paperwork required of volunteer dog-walkers at the Humane Society of Summit County.  Volunteers are requested to note the time they interact with animals so the shelter can track the interaction and ensure that none of the animals are being neglected.  It's consistes of a simple log and a grid of daily activity allowing volunteers to see at a glance which animals are most in need of some quality time.

PAWS brings tha log to the web, but adds some additional features the simple paper system can't do.

This is a NodeJS application utilizing a number of well-known modules: Chalk, Express, Express-Session, MySQL, Passport, WS and others.
